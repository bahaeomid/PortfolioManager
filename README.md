##Credits
The majority of the computations in this program are based upon the concepts taught in the [Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics](http://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/econ424/econ424.htm) course by Dr. Eric Zivot of the University of Washington. 

I am compelled to mention that Dr. Zivot did not directly have any involvement in the development of the product. Hence, any issues with the accuracy of the calculations and the results presented is attributed to the developer's understanding.
